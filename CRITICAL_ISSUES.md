# Critical Issues

## 1. Syntax Errors
- **main.js**: Contains duplicated code and references undefined functions
- **server.js**: Has issues in memory handling logic and token checking
- **bundle.css**: Contains invalid CSS syntax that would break styling

## 2. Process Management
- **start.js**: Improper process management could lead to orphaned processes
- **main.js**: Backend process termination is not properly handled

## 3. Memory Management
- Vector memory implementation may have issues with token counting
- Potential memory leaks in the server implementation

## 4. Code Organization
- Duplicate components across the codebase
- Inconsistent file naming conventions
- Redundant functionality in multiple files
